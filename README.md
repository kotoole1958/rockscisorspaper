This projct entails a game call rock scissors paper. I have based the project around a javascript tutorial I had viewed o youTube entitled "Learn Javascript by building 7 games" by Ania Kubow. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk by Ania KUBOW)

I have changed  number of the variables in the coding. It is also my intention to change the eventlistener coding, add sytle coding and further dvelop the game. Th coding t the moment uses functinal interfaces and shorthand fr setting up functions in the one line. I do intend in future to use the coding that I encountered in Love Maths.

I ran into some difficulties in trying to get the existing coding to run proprly in the browser but I intend to correct this next time round. This is just a first attempt which I intend to make my own
